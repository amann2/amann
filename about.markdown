My name is Andrew Mann and I'm currently working on getting my PhD at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm studying machine learning techniques for numerically solving problems in materials science. The goal of my research is to efficiently identify the process-structure-property linkages in multi-scale material modeling. Through this work, my lab hopes to reduce the time required to discover and manufacture new materials.

Outside of work I love to run, cook, read, take pictures, and learn continuously. I'm sure I'll talk about these interests at some point throughout the life of this blog!
