There's too much hiding on the internet, so this is me. My name is Andrew Mann and I'm currently getting a doctorate at Georgia Tech in Materials Science and Engineering - but my work is more focused the convergence of data science and materials engineering. I'm naturally very curious about how the world works and I'm very lucky that my work aligns with my curiosity. For better or worse, this alignment of curiosity and work means that I work a lot - but I do enjoy it. My curiosity about how the world works leads me to read frequently about how people think and behave. This could be interesting biographies, books about investing, or histories of World War II. I'm also interested in human performance and efficiency, so I spend a lot of time running and cycling, reading about diets, and learning about [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/). I also probably spend too much time cooking and baking, but come on, its the perfect combination of chemistry and satisfaction so who wouldn't love to bake cookies.
