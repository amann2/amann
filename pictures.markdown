*Yosemite Valley. One of the best places I have ever been.*

*Took this picture from my car on the road through Death Valley.*

![Sunrise at Olympic National Park](/assets/sunrise_olympic_nat_park.jpg)
*One of my favorites. Waking up early at the campsite and driving up the mountain was such a good call - catching the sun come up over the cloudline was incredible.*

![Sioux Falls](/assets/sioux_falls.jpg)
*One of the first times I went out with my camera. Pleased with how the lighting looks.*
