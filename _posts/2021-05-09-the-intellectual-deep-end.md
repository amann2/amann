This past week I emerged from the back side of my first year in graduate school at Georgia Tech. I think its safe to say that graduate school is one of the most challenging tasks I have encountered and is already full of lessons learned. It has opened my eyes to some glaring weaknesses in my skill set (as it should), it has shown me where my understanding of graduate school was wrong, and it has made me even more excited for the growth and progress I will make in the future. But when thinking back over this past year, there are a few major areas where I was wrong about what's involved in graduate school - and in a broader sense life in the 'real world'. 

The main source of where I was wrong about graduate school was in my belief that getting a PhD was essentially a continuation of undergraduate school, but with the main difference that its more challenging and the time allocation balance shifts to include more research and less coursework. I knew that there were other differences, but this was what it all boiled down to in my mind. So I entered graduate school with the same mindset that I had used with a lot of success in my undergraduate degree - figure out the requirements needed for graduation and start checking off the items. By operating with this mindset, I thought all I needed to do to get my PhD and move on with my life was to finish my coursework as soon as possible, write some journal articles, get my dissertation together, defend it, and move on. In hindsight, this mindset was obviously very naive. But I don't blame myself for it - after all, my entire life up to this point had reinforced that mindset. There are some major issues when trying to finish a PhD with this mindset though. They all come down to the fact that a PhD is much more like the "real world" than an undergraduate degree. By this I mean that while there are easily identifiable requirements to graduate, the playing field is much, much murkier, uncertain, dynamic, and competitive. Oh, and you're solely responsible for gaining the intellectual tool set required to graduate.

When you're growing up, you're typically protected from major intellectual harm by your superiors and the school system. In school, you're in an environment where there are right and wrong answers to the problems presented to you. While there is nothing wrong with this (after all, its important to learn the fundamentals where there *are* right and wrong answers), it often doesn't prepare you with a mental model that's capable of succeeding in the real world. This is because there rarely are strictly right and wrong answers to questions - the real world is dynamic, complex, uncertain, and multi-objective. And this is where my undergraduate mindset was blown apart by graduate school. I was prepared my whole life with this mindset of "checking requirements off the list" and getting right answers on tests in order to move on to the next level. But graduate school is like real life. Even though there are clear and identifiable requirements, the path to achieving the requirements is murky, uncertain, dynamic. And you're not equipped to traverse the path, you have to develop the tools along the way.

So to summarize my issue, when I started graduate school last fall, I had a mental checklist for what needed to be accomplished in order to graduate - all I needed to do was finish the checklist as soon as possible and I could move on with my life. But I couldn't use that strategy for getting my degree. Graduate school is a place where the main goal is to *develop a new mental model that is capable of handling a dynamic, uncertain, and multi-objective world*. So the playing field and rules are totally different. Drawing the parallel between real life and graduate school in another way, Paul Graham [says](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) that being an adult is about taking intellectual responsibility for yourself. I think this is spot on for doctoral students as well - the process of getting a PhD is about learning how to take intellectual responsibility and ownership of your ideas and research. 

With this outlook, I think a better summary of graduate school can be stated in two parts: (1) publish a dissertation that advances the scientific community's current understanding and (2) develop new mental models that are capable of operating within "real world" and broader scientific community. These two goals are deeply interrelated - you cannot achieve one without the other. Now that I've reached this conclusion, the obvious next question is "how?". If the situation isn't as black and white as getting good grades and writing a good dissertation, then how in the world do you develop the skills to question assumptions and make judgements in uncertain situations?

My best guess at answering the "how?" question isn't novel or ground breaking in any way. In fact, I think its fairly simply (the best solutions are often the most straightforward) and consists of three things: read, write, and converse. Thankfully, graduate schools have figured this recipe out reading, writing, and speaking are non-negotiables in any program. But reading, writing, and conversing are only beneficial for developing new mental models if you're aware of the *purpose* for the activities. So its important to frame these tasks from the standpoint of a PhD program. In other words, if you blindly read a journal article with an undergraduate mindset, you'll read it like a textbook and take everything as 100 percent correct. But from a PhD mindset, you'll read the article and look for holes in the assumptions and methods and you'll aim to identify areas where the results and conclusions don't align. This perspective shift is only possible if you're aware of the *purpose* for reading the journal article.

From the standpoint of advancing the scientific community and developing new mental models, what is the purpose of reading, writing, and conversing? Reading provides the opportunity for finding new ideas, new questions to ask, new experiments and methods to explore. Since the scientific community is so vast and diverse, its extremely important to read as much as possible - but equally important to read *actively*. Active reading is what brings us to writing. Writing requires a second layer of thinking on top of reading. In order to write, you must think critically and carefully with what you are typing. You have to actually work to construct a logical sentence, paragraph, and paper. This process forces you to digest the papers and books you read and will reveal areas that you haven't read carefully enough. After all, if you can't sufficiently summarize a paper then you likely didn't read it or understand it well enough and must go back and actively read it again. So reading expands your intellectual horizons and writing solidifies the ideas. Conversing (or speaking) is similar to writing - its another exercise for digesting and formulating ideas that you encounter by reading the literature. I think an important difference is that speaking requires a bit more critical thinking than writing since its "on the fly". Basically, you'll understand very quickly if you actually understand something or not because you'll either do a good job explaining an argument to a colleague or you'll fail miserably. Conversing also provides an efficient outlet for having your ideas tested and refined by peers. You'll receive quick feedback from peers on the quality of ideas and the process will expose you to other views on the problems and suggested solutions you propose.

Not to discount my experience, but I don't think these ideas and the journey I've gone through are particularly unique for someone in the first year in a doctorate program. After all, every student comes in with more or less the same set of tools from their previous 22 years. In fact, I would argue that these realizations aren't even unique to PhD students - these lessons can apply to anyone making the transition from college to their first full time job. From my internship experience, things are much less cut and dry at big engineering companies than one might expect. Finally to end - identifying a problem and a potential solution is comparatively easy to actually changing mental models and behaviors. Since the world is so uncertain, chaotic, and challenging, a tremendous amount of effort and care is required to identify the areas of your life that are inhibiting progress and the areas of your life that are cultivating progress. It's tricky to parse through the murkiness and isolate things that need changing and train things that need work. But I believe I have a good start with my cycle of reading, writing, and conversing.
