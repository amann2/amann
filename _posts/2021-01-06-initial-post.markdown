# Welcome! 

To kick off this project, I think it would be appropriate to start off answering the question of “Why start a blog?” Especially now - when life is so hectic and I seem to be as busy as ever. I’ve been thinking about starting a blog/personal website for a few years now. But there are a few things that have prompted me to pull the trigger now:

* I've done a lot of moving over the last year which means I have met a lot of incredible people, but I’ve also moved away from some dear friends. I thought a blog would be a good way to keep everyone up to date.
* I've had the urge to create. I recently came to the conclusion that I've spent my whole life absorbing information, but I usually stop there. I haven’t moved forward towards creating or adding value. A blog will provide an avenue for "creation" and publishing my thoughts.
* Lastly, a blog is a tool for learning. I hope that in writing each post, I will improve my writing ability and increase my knowledge. I also hope that what I produce in each post will be something useful for those who stumble across this corner of the internet.

More or less, those are the driving forces behind why I started this project now. I hope you'll bear with me throughout the life of this blog - I’m certain there will be growing pains as I refine my ability.

It's also my hope that the audience for this blog grows beyond people whom I already know. With this goal in mind, an introduction seems appropriate! My name is Andrew Mann and I'm currently living in Atlanta, GA while I pursue a PhD at Georgia Tech in the Computer Science and Engineering program. I’m focusing my research efforts on data science approaches for improving our ability to quickly and efficiently evaluate candidate material systems so that the rate of improvement in material design is increased. This basically means I like machine learning, physics, and chemistry. Before grad school, I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Liberty University in Lynchburg, VA (where I lived for ~16 years). There’s a chance I could be considered a nerd, but I just like to think of myself as curious. This means I generally spend a fair amount of my time researching topics in technology, economics, and human behavior. Outside of my more academic side - you can find me running, cooking, or reading. Typical books on my bookshelf are biographies, personal improvement books, theology books, or historical books (particularly interested in WWII era and its impact on science, technology, foreign affairs, and economy). I'm sure I'll dedicate some posts to each of these topics in the future.

The last piece of information I'd like to address with this initial post are my intentions for each individual post. I think goals and guidelines are important for any task, especially a self-directed project. With that in mind, I'm aiming for a minimum of a post on average every 2 weeks. Right now that is a loose target - I may find myself posting more often, or posting less often, we'll just have to see how it unfolds. The only guideline I'm giving myself for each post is that I I find value in writing the article and I believe other people will also find value in it. I don't want to write for the sake of writing. I want to learn from each post and I want to provide value to the people reading each post. Whether it's a life update post, an article about a new topic I've come across in my research, a book review, or something else entirelyI've stumbled across in my life, the post must provide value. So, let's see where this goes!

Also, I enjoy taking pictures (when I have the time..) so check out some of my [favorites](https://andy-mann.github.io/pictures/).
